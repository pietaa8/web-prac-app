Project Overview:
This project is a web based platform designed to streamline the appointment and consultation process between legal professionals and clients. It allows users to register, choose legal consultants, book appointments, and pay online using a secure payment gateway. Legal consultants can manage their schedules, view client details, and provide updates. Admins have full control over system management, including monitoring users, consultants, andÂ transactions.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, here two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
